# Why? 🤔
- I made this website for a local business. I wanted to practice and develop my skills in semantic HTML content structure, CSS structure, media queries, Flexbox, and JavaScript functionality. My goal was to create a fully responsive website with multiple interactive funcionalities and Google Maps API integration.

# What I learned? 👨‍💻
- How to integrate Google Maps API and make a custom marker
- Desktop first design approach is problematic. I had many issues with getting the desired responsive behaviour using media queries and spent days getting to the bottom of some of the buggy behavior. It's better to start with a simple mobile design and add complexity at larger screen sizes as opposed to making a complex desktop design first and removing bits of the UI as the screen size shrinks.
